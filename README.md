-how would I know if this link actually works?-
### Links

- Solution URL: [Add solution URL here]([https://your-solution-url.com](https://meddifera.github.io/frontendMentorRecipePage/))
OMG WTH is the solution URL?! I have no idea! Ok so I did some github pages thing and I got the page running but the image was missing. So then I uploaded a whole bunch of fonts and image but there's no changes to the page. It is what is I guess. Future thanks for any magic internet people who will nicely help this clueless dingo but I'll most probably forget about it and come back to the same issue. *sigh*

## My process

I started writing out the HTML paying close attention to web accessability and then finished off with CSS. Because this is a very simple page, I didn't have to wrestle with the responsive part thanks to the magic of modern css I guess. To be honest, the hardest part is this git bit. I'm not even sure if I'm doing this correctly. Oh well, if I'm not, I'll just look like an idiot to my future self but since I'm very unjudgemental, I guess it's not the end of the world.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
I learnt about web accesibility in this challenge and creating the table at the end of the page was quite challenging. Also I'm not sure if I've uploaded this correctly but fingers crossed and hopefully I'll learn.

### Continued development

This is one of the more simpler page I've attempted because there's not much going on here. I will continue to challenge myself with harder challenges but I will be taking snail steps because I'm slowbro.

### Useful resources

The problem is I googled so much it'll take pages to link all the resources. I guess you just have to keep trying until you find your solution. Maybe I should take better notes next time too...
